            <p>Hi, I'm Max. I'm a software developer, avid investor, and all-around tech enthusiast. I enjoy exploring new technologies, building computers, and trying out the latest gadgets. When I'm not at a computer, you'll find me outdoors enjoying nature, fitness, cars, and music.
                <br>
                <br> I graduated from Illinois Wesleyan University in 2012 with a degree in business finance. I had always been fascinated by computers and found myself signing up for every CS course I could fit in my schedule. Several years later, I'm working as back-end Java developer and haven't looked back since. I enjoy solving technical challenges and learning new things every day.
                <br>
                <br> As the web continues to grow and becomes increasingly prevalant in our everyday lives, I feel it is important to expand my skills in this area. I am excited to begin my journey in learning the tools and practices of modern front-end web development.
                <br>
                <br> Feel free to look around and check back for updates on my upcoming projects!</p>
